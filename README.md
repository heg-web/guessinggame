# Guessing Game

This fun and easy project "Guess the Number" is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer and involves the following steps:

1. The system generates a random secret number from a given range, say 1 to 100.
2. The user is prompted to enter their guess number in a displayed dialogue box.
3. The computer then tells if the entered number matches or is higher/lower than the secret number.
4. The game continues until the user guesses the secret number.

## Compile and Run

Inside the `src`  folder

Compile
```
javac GuessingGame.java
```
Run
```
java GuessingGame
```

## Improvement Ideas

You can incorporate further details:
- Improving the code syntax, for example:
    - Add error handling for non-integer user input.
    - Use constants for the minimum and maximum values instead of hardcoding them.
    - Use a do-while loop
Add comments to explain the purpose of the code and each method.
- Limiting the number of attempts. 
- Playing another round. 
- Choose a difficulty level
- Displaying score. 
- Giving points based on the number of attempts.
